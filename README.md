# BucketBank

This is a Java application that allows users to view their banking accounts and create sub accounts called "buckets" that allow the user to split up their funds into smaller accounts and label them for different purposes so that they have a visual reminder of what they are saving for.

An example of this would be having one bucket for a Beyonce concert ticket, another bucket for a trip to Japan, and another bucket for a new computer. Some people may not want to open multiple savings accounts for all these goals as they often come with monthly service fees to keep them all open. It can be hard saving for so many things and not knowing how much money you've put towards each goal, so BucketBank was created to solve that issue.

I have plans to either create a Java GUI interface, or to turn this into a website for a better user interface using React.
